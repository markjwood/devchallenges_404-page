This project was a good refresher. While I am fairly comfortable with HTML and CSS, this was a good reminder that I need to practice those skills daily, as I found some aspects of this project to be more challenging than I expected. As I worked through it, though, things started to come back to me.

It was a fun project, if a bit humbling.
